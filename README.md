Thesis Chapter 4

This repository contains the code used in chapter 4 of the thesis: Understanding how mutability facilitates survival of alternating selection and botlenecks by the major food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni (2023)

The code used is listed as follows:

Extracting_Gene_Tables.py <- Extracts phasomeit output data into gene tables for a set of isolates
Grouping_Pirate_Output.py <- This code takes the Pirate output files and sorts the gene groups into fasta files for those with detected repeat tracts present in the sequence. 
CODEML_RunFile.ctl        <- File used to run PAML on PIRATE output groups

The data for this chapter was generated using PhasomeIT with default campylobacter search parameters as outlined in PhasomeIt: an 'omics' approach to cataloguing the potential breadth of phase variation in the genus Campylobacter (2018)
